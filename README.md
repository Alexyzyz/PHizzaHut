## PHizzaHut

### What the fuck is this?
*PHizza Hut* is a website that we're building as our final project submission for a college web programming course.

Make sure you read the file **O202-COMP6144-PH03-00.docx** for the project's description. Leave the file **Template Dokumentasi Eksternal.docx** for later. Notify me before you go making branches all willy-nilly :>

### What kind of name is that?
It's not *my* idea.

### To-do list
Here's a bunch of things that still need to be done:

- [ ] Update the database to include `Cart`
- [ ] Add `Add Pizza`, `Edit Pizza`, and `Delete Pizza` pages for Admins
- [ ] Add `Transactions` and `Cart` pages for Members

### Where's the class diagram?
Here it is. Make sure you treat the database well :-)
